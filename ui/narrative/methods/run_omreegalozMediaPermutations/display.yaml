description : |
    <p> This app runs FBA with or without various compounds. For example, if you include the compounds "a" and "b" in the Variable Compounds, then it will run FBA with compounds "a" and "b" together, then it will run FBA with only "a", then only "b", then neither, and compare the results. </p>
